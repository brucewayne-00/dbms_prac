-- STEP 1: Create Tables

CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_name VARCHAR(30) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    assets DECIMAL(15,2) CHECK (assets >= 0)
);

CREATE TABLE Account (
    acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(30),
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (balance >= 0),
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_street VARCHAR(50),
    cust_city VARCHAR(30)
);

CREATE TABLE Depositor (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    acc_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, acc_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (acc_no) REFERENCES Account(acc_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(30),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (amount > 0),
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    loan_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, loan_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_no) REFERENCES Loan(loan_no)
);

-- STEP 2: Insert Sample Data

INSERT INTO Branch VALUES ('Nigdi', 'Pune', 900000.00);
INSERT INTO Branch VALUES ('Akurdi', 'Pune', 1200000.00);

INSERT INTO Customer VALUES ('Alice', 'MG Road', 'Pune');
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES ('Bob', 'FC Road', 'Pune');

INSERT INTO Account VALUES (101, 'Nigdi', 18000.00);
INSERT INTO Account VALUES (102, 'Akurdi', 22000.00);

INSERT INTO Depositor VALUES ('Alice', 101);
INSERT INTO Depositor VALUES ('Bob', 102);

INSERT INTO Loan VALUES (1, 'Nigdi', 1400.00);
INSERT INTO Loan VALUES (2, 'Nigdi', 1700.00);
INSERT INTO Loan VALUES (3, 'Akurdi', 15000.00);

INSERT INTO Borrower VALUES ('Alice', 1);
INSERT INTO Borrower VALUES ('Bob', 3);

-- STEP 3: Query 1 - Calculate total loan amount

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_loan_amount FROM Loan;

-- STEP 4: Query 2 - Delete all loans with amount between 1300 and 1500

DELETE FROM Loan WHERE amount BETWEEN 1300 AND 1500;

-- STEP 5: Query 3 - Delete all tuples at every branch located in 'Nigdi'

DELETE FROM Borrower WHERE loan_no IN (
    SELECT loan_no FROM Loan WHERE branch_name = 'Nigdi'
);

DELETE FROM Depositor WHERE acc_no IN (
    SELECT acc_no FROM Account WHERE branch_name = 'Nigdi'
);

DELETE FROM Account WHERE branch_name = 'Nigdi';
DELETE FROM Loan WHERE branch_name = 'Nigdi';
DELETE FROM Branch WHERE branch_name = 'Nigdi';
