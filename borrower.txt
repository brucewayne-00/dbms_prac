-- STEP 1: Drop existing objects if they exist
DROP VIEW borrower_view;
DROP SEQUENCE borrower_seq;
DROP SYNONYM borrower_synonym;
DROP INDEX idx_borrower_rollin;
DROP TABLE Borrower;

-- STEP 2: Create Borrower table with constraints
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    Rollin NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    DateofIssue DATE NOT NULL,
    NameofBook VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    Status CHAR(1) CHECK (Status IN ('I', 'R'))
);

-- STEP 3: Create sequence for Rollin
CREATE SEQUENCE borrower_seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
NOCACHE
NOCYCLE;

-- STEP 4: Create index on Rollin
CREATE INDEX idx_borrower_rollin ON Borrower(Rollin);

-- STEP 5: Create view to show issued books only
CREATE VIEW borrower_view AS
SELECT Rollin, Name, NameofBook, DateofIssue
FROM Borrower
WHERE Status = 'I';

-- STEP 6: Create synonym for Borrower table
CREATE SYNONYM borrower_synonym FOR Borrower;

-- STEP 7: Insert sample records using sequence
INSERT INTO Borrower (Rollin, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status) 
VALUES (borrower_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Alice', TO_DATE('2025-05-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Oracle Database Concepts', 'I');

INSERT INTO Borrower (Rollin, Name, DateofIssue, NameofBook, Status) 
VALUES (borrower_seq.NEXTVAL, 'Bob', TO_DATE('2025-04-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'PL/SQL Programming', 'R');

-- STEP 8: Select all borrowers
SELECT * FROM Borrower;

-- STEP 9: Select from view (only issued books)
SELECT * FROM borrower_view;

-- STEP 10: Use synonym to select all
SELECT * FROM borrower_synonym;
